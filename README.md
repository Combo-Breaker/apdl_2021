Notebook with baseline code: https://www.kaggle.com/code/combobreaker/sample-and-baselines-submission

Evaluation formula:

- baseline_mark_i: if your achieved score >= baseline_i (i = 4,5,6)
- leaderboard_mark: 6 + ( 4 * (N - pos + 1) / N) if your score >= baseline_6

your final mark = max(baseline_mark_i, leaderboard_mark)
